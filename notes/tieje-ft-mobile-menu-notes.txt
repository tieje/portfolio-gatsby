I want to add a menu button for the mobile interface that brings up the sidebar navigation.

I've discovered that I cannot actually re-render components,
at least not very easily due to Gatsby being a static site generator...
Sad...

<div
    className="bg-white w-11 rounded-full fixed top-6 left-4 z-10 grid place-content-center md-invisible"
    onClick={() => {
        (visibility === 'invisible') ? setVisibility('visible') : setVisibility('invisible')
        console.log(visibility)
    }}
>
    <StaticImage
        src="../images/menu.png"
        alt="Open menu icons created by ariefstudio - Flaticon"
        height={20}
        className="m-3 z-auto"
        onClick={() => {
            (visibility === 'invisible') ? setVisibility('visible') : setVisibility('invisible')
            console.log(visibility)
        }}
    />
</div>

I'll just keep things the way they are for now. It's not a big deal.
