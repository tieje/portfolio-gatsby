          I have decided that the best implementation for my small site is to simply query everything once and provide it to everything.
          Gatsby forces me to grab everything all at once in one query...
          x look in the React Context solution. Grab all the data at once and make it globally available like Apollo
            The context solution is too complex and I don't really know what I'm doing.
        + try creating a graphql query that grabs the correct image
