Well, that was a long break.
+ Plan out what technologies you'll use to build the site.
- Design the website with Figma.
    # You'll want to showcase your original Figma design on your portfolio site.
- Build HTML + CSS components that are reactive to screen size.
- Add animation? with Animxyz?

HTML
Tailwind - Styling
Animxyz - animation

+ set up gatsby, gatsby cloud, and tailwind css
    + It turns out a developer created the plugin for gatsby but it's recognized yet
    + tailwind css uses postcss

I've realized that the actual start of the project is:

+ get tailwind css intellisense working on vscode
+ design the website on Figma and showcase the design on your README
    + design the homepage
        + desktop + tablet - 2/16/2022
        ~ mobile - 2/18/2022
            The mobile version will be the same thing but the sticky menu will minimize to a button and will pull to the right covering half the screen.
    + design a project component and what it will look like
        + desktop + tablet - 2/18/2022
    + Add footer component - 2/18/2022


+ switch the project over to typescript for Gatsby

In order to use images in Gatsby, it looks like you'll need to use their image loader.
Who am I to complain? They're hosting my site for free.
